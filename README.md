# exhMonad

Computing exhaustification in haskell (directly inspired by https://github.com/KenyC/Exh). This is currently WIP and extremely messy!

https://github.com/patrl/hExh/blob/master/propLogic.ipynb contains a propositional fragment enriched with exhaustification operators.

https://github.com/patrl/hExh/blob/master/sauerlandAlts.ipynb contains a demonstration of how to implement Sauerland's algorithm for computing alternatives using the pointed-set monad. Exhaustification is implemented here as a special interpretation rule.
